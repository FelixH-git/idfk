An RSSI BLE based distance sensor, with some fancy ass hacker graphics, fucking based. 
(do not use this, the code is bad, i dont like lvgl), rn(idk why) it just draws how many fkin devices
are nearby, does not draw them with a ceratin zoom which pisses me off


buy a 
```
ESP32-C6-LCD-1.47
```
and then flash with Arduino IDE
