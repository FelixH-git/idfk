An RSSI BLE-based distance sensor with some cool hacker-style graphics—very nice!

(Do not use this code; it's not great, and I don't like LVGL.) Right now, for some reason, it just displays the number of nearby devices instead of positioning them with a certain zoom, which is frustrating.

Please do not run the code—it resets after drawing the devices due to an overloaded buffer (not sure how to fix that).

Buy an
```
ESP32-C6-LCD-1.47
```
and flash it with the Arduino IDE.

Here's the device—check it out! So cool:
